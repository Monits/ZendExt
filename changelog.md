## 1.6 (under development)
 > ZendExt is now dual-licensed under both Apache 2 and New BSD licenses

 - **(Improvement)** Make the output of the code generator more verbose.
 - **(Fix)** Allow generators and `ZendExt_Db_Schema` to work with PostgreSQL.

 - **(Improvement)** Use our open source super poms for better management.
 - **(Improvement)** Crons can now specify the environment in which to run through config.

 - **(Improvement)** Added `phpunit.xml` for proper running of tests in all environments.

 - **(Improvement)** Added a set of `_queryFor*Shards` methods to `ZendExt_Db_Dao_Abstract` to allow executing custom queries that may not fit in a `ZendExt_Db_Dao_Select` of the `_insert`, `_update` and `_delete` methods.
 - **(Improvement)** Allow to download third party dependencies (such as Facebook's SDK) from Monits' repositories.
